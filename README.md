This is a variant of the system described here: https://elifesciences.org/articles/56426. 
The main differences are its inverted (parabolic reflector on the bottom) and its 24 (not 96) wells.

a) plate holder (with baffle to reduce stray light - a second lens holder without lenses)
c) 24 element lens array (plano-convex, 50mm focal length, 12.5 mm diameter, glass)
g) Sample holder (24 well plate, 18mm pitch, 13.5 mm diameter, plastic bottom)
f) LED array holder with collimating lenses (10 mm diameter, 15 mm focal length, clear plastic)
d) Periscope (two flat mirrors, 50mm x 125 mm, 3.1mm thick (float glass))


The camera is a 4x6 mm square CMOS sensor mounted in a CS housing (CS-mount   flange focal distance (FFD) = 12.526 mm, and the outer diameter of the cylindrical lens mount is 1 inch )
